# Overview

`artMS` is an R package that provides a set of tools for the analysis and 
integration of large-scale proteomics (mass-spectrometry-based) datasets  
obtained using the popular proteomics software package 
[MaxQuant](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/5111795/maxquant). 
The functions available at `artMS` can be grouped into 4 major categories:

- Multiple quality control (QC) functions.
- Relative quantification using [MSstats](http://msstats.org/).
- Downstream analysis and integration of quantifications (enrichment, 
clustering, PCA, summary plots, etc)
- Generation of input files for other tools, including [SAINTq and SAINTexpress](http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html), 
[Photon](https://github.com/jdrudolph/photon), 
and [Phosfate](http://phosfate.com/)


`artMS` performs the different analyses taking as input the following files:

- `evidence.txt` file: The output of the quantitative proteomics software 
package `MaxQuant`. 
- `keys.txt` (tab-delimited) txt file generated by the user describing 
the experimental designed (check below to learn how to create it).
- `contrast.txt` (tab-delimited) txt file generated by the user with the 
comparisons between conditions to be quantified (check below to learn 
how to create it).
- `config.yaml`: a configuration file which enables the customization of 
a number of parameters for the quantification (and other operations, 
including QC analyses, charts and annotations). A configuration file 
template can be generated by running `artmsWriteConfigYamlFile()`










# How to install

We assume that you have both R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) 
already installed on your system. Please, ensure that your system is 
running an `R version >= 3.5` or otherwise nothing will work (Bioconductor 
requirement). You can check the R version currently running on your system 
by executing this command in RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getRversion()
```

If the outcome is `>= 3.5.0`, congratulations! you can move forward

*If it is not, then you need to [install the latest version of R in your system](https://www.r-project.org/)*. After updating to the latest R version, 
open RStudio and try again `getRversion()` to make sure it worked.

Two options to install `artMS`

### Official bioconductor releases

`artMS` is currently under revision by BioConductor. Once accepted:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("artMS")
```


### Development version from this repo 

Assuming that you have an `R (>= 3.5)` version running on your system, 
follow these steps:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("biodavidjm/artMS")
```

- Check that it is up and running by checking, for example, the documentation 
of the QC function `artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(artMS)
?artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic
```

Once installed, we suggest you to do a quick test by running the quality 
control functions using the "evidence" (`artms_data_ph_evidence`) and 
"keys" (`artms_data_ph_keys`) files included in `artMS` as test datasets.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(artMS)
suppressWarnings(
  artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic(evidence_file = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                                 keys_file = artms_data_ph_keys, 
                                 prot_exp =  "PH", 
                                 plotINTDIST = FALSE,
                                 plotREPRO = TRUE,
                                 plotCORMAT = FALSE,
                                 plotINTMISC = FALSE,
                                 plotPTMSTATS = FALSE,
                                 printPDF = FALSE,
                                 verbose = FALSE))
```

(To learn more about these testing datasets, check the documentation by 
running `?artms_data_ph_keys` or `?artms_data_ph_evidence` on the R console)


Once the QC is done, go to the folder `"/path/to/your/working/directory/"` 
and check out all the generated QC (pdf) files.











# Input files

Three basic (tab-delimited) files are required to perform the full pack of 
operations:

## `evidence.txt`

The output of the quantitative proteomics software package [MaxQuant](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/5111795/maxquant). It combines all the 
information about the identified peptides.

## `keys.txt`

Tab delimited file generated by the user. It summarizes the experimental 
design of the evidence file. When using `artMS`, the `keys.txt` file will
be merged with the `evidence.txt` by the "RawFile" column. Each RawFile 
corresponds to a unique individual experimental technical replicate / 
biological replicate / Condition / Run. 

For any basic label-free proteomics experiment, the keys file must contain the 
following columns:

- **RawFile**: The name of the RAW-file for which the mass spectral data was 
derived from.
- **IsotopeLabelType**: `'L'` for label free experiments (`'H'` will be used 
for SILAC experiments, see below)
- **Condition**: 
    - Use only numbers (0 - 9) and the letters (A - Z, both uppercase and 
    lowercase) for the Conditions' names. The only special character allowed 
    is underscore (`_`).
    - A condition name CANNOT start with a number.
- **BioReplicate**: biological replicate number. Use as prefix the 
corresponding  `Condition` name, and add as suffix a `dash (-)` and the 
number of biological replicate. For example, if condition `H1N1_06H` has 
too biological replicates, name them as `H1N1_06H-1` and  `H1N1_06H-2`
- **Run**: a number for all the MS runs. It will be specially useful when
having technical replicates.

Example of keys file: check the data object `artms_data_ph_keys`

**RawFile**|**IsotopeLabelType**|**Condition**|**BioReplicate**|**Run**
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
qx006145|L|Cal33|Cal33-1|1
qx006148|L|Cal33|Cal33-4|4
qx006151|L|HSC6|HSC6-2|6
qx006152|L|HSC6|HSC6-3|7

*Tip*: it is recommended to use Microsoft Excel (OpenOffice Cal / or similar) 
to generate the keys file. *Do not forget* to choose the 
*format = Tab Delimited Text (.txt)* when saving the file 
(use *save as* option)

## `contrast.txt`

The comparisons between conditions that the user wants to quantify. 
For example, to quantify changes in protein abundance between wild type 
`WT_A549` relative to two additional experimental conditions with drugs 
`WT_DRUG_A` and `WT_DRUG_B`, but also changes in protein abundance between
`DRUG_A` and `DRUG_B`, the contrast file would look like this:

```
WT_DRUG_A-WT_A549
WT_DRUG_B-WT_A549
WT_DRUG_A-WT_DRUG_B
```

**Requirements**: 

- The two conditions to be compared must be separated by a dash symbol (`-`),
and only one dash symbol is allowed, i.e., only one comparison per line.

As a result of the quantification, the condition on the left will take the 
positive log2FC sign -if the protein is more abundant in condition 
`WT_DRUG_A`, and the condition on the right the negative log2FC -if a 
protein is more abundant in condition `WT_A549`.












## The configuration file (`.yaml`)

The configuration file (in `yaml` format) contains the configuration 
details for the quantification performed by `artMS` using `MSstats`. 

To generate a sample configuration file, go to the project folder 
(`setwd(/path/to/your/working/folder/)`) and execute:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsWriteConfigYamlFile(config_file_name = "config.yaml" )
```

Open the `config.yaml` file with your favorite editor (RStudio works 
very well as well). *Although it might look complex, the default 
options work very well*. 

The configuration (`yaml`) file contains the following sections:

### Section: `files`

```
files :
  evidence : /path/to/the/evidence.txt
  keys : /path/to/the/keys.txt
  contrasts : /path/to/the/contrast.txt
  output : /path/to/the/results_folder/ph-results.txt
```

The file `path/name` of the required files. It is recommended to create 
a new folder in your folder project (for example, `results_folder`). 
The results file name (e.g. `-results.txt`) will be used as prefix for the 
several files (`txt` and `pdf`) that will be generated.

---

### Section: `qc`

```
qc:
  basic: 1 # 1 = yes; 0 = no
  extended: 1 # 1 = yes; 0 = no
```

Select to perform both 'basic' and 'extended' quality control. Read below 
to find out more about the details of each type of analysis.

### Section: `data`

```
data:
  enabled : 1 # 1 = yes; 0 = no
  fractions: 
    enabled : 0 # 1 for protein fractionation
  silac: 
    enabled : 0 # 1 for SILAC experiments
  filters: 
    enabled : 1
    contaminants : 1
    protein_groups : remove # remove, keep
    modifications : AB # PH, UB, AB, APMS
  sample_plots : 1 # correlation plots
```

Let's break it down `data`:

- `enabled`:
      - `1`: to pre-process the data provided in the *files* section.
      - `0`: won't process the data (and a pre-generated MSstats file will 
      be expected)

- `fractions`: Multiple fractionation or separation methods are often 
combined in proteomics to improve signal-to-noise and proteome coverage 
and to reduce interference between peptides in quantitative proteomics.
      - `enabled : 1` for fractionation dataset. See 
      **Special case: Protein Fractionation** below for details
      - `enabled : 0` no fractions

- `silac`:
    - `enabled : 1`: check if the files belong to a SILAC experiment. 
    See **Special case: SILAC** below for details
    - `enabled : 0`: it does not

- `filters`: 
    -  `enabled : 1` Enables filtering
    -  `contaminants : 1` Removes contaminants (`CON__` and `REV__` 
    labeled by MaxQuant)
    - `protein_groups : remove` choose whether `remove` or `keep` 
    protein groups
    -  `modifications : AB` any of the proteomics experiments, `PH`, 
    `UB`, or `AC` for posttranslational modifications, `AB` or `APMS` 
    otherwise.

- `sample_plots` 
    - `1` Generate correlation plots
    - `0` otherwise

---

### Section: `msstats`

```
msstats :
  enabled : 1
  msstats_input : 
  profilePlots : none 
  normalization_method : equalizeMedians 
  normalization_reference :  
  summaryMethod : TMP 
  censoredInt : NA  
  cutoffCensored : minFeature  
  MBimpute : 1 
  feature_subset: all
```

Let's break it down:

- `enabled : ` Choose `1` to run MSstats, `0` otherwise.
- `msstats_input :` blank if MSstats is going to be run (`enabled : 1`). 
But if otherwise (`enabled : 0) then provide the path to the previously 
generated `evidence-mss.txt`
- `profilePlots :` Several profile plots available. 
    * `before` plots only before normalization
    * `after` plots only after normalization
    * `before-after`: recommended, although computational expensive (time 
    consuming)
    * `none` no normalization plots (convenient if time limitations)

- `normalization_method :` available options:
    - `equalizeMedians`
    - `quantile`
    - `0`: no normalization (not recommended)
    - `globalStandards` if selected, specified the reference protein in 
    `normalization_reference` (next)
- `normalization_reference :` an UniProt id if `globalStandards` is chosen 
as the `normalization_method` (above)
- `summaryMethod :` TMP # "TMP"(default) means Tukey's median polish, which 
is robust estimation method. "linear" uses linear mixed model. "logOfSum" 
conducts log2 (sum of intensities) per run.
- `censoredInt :` 
    - `NA`  Missing values are censored or at random. 'NA' (default) assumes 
    that all 'NA's in 'Intensity' column are censored. 
    - `0` uses zero intensities as censored intensity. In this case, 
    NA intensities are missing at random. The output from Skyline should use 
    `0`. Null assumes that all `NA` intensities are randomly missing.
- `cutoffCensored :` 
    - `minFeature` Cutoff value for censoring. Only with `censoredInt='NA'`
    or `0`. Default is 'minFeature', which uses minimum value for each feature.
    - `minFeatureNRun` uses the smallest between minimum value of corresponding
    feature and minimum value of corresponding run. 
    - `minRun` uses minimum value for each run.
- `MBimpute :` 
    - `TRUE` only for `summaryMethod="TMP"` and `censoredInt='NA'` or `0`. 
    TRUE (default) imputes 'NA' or '0' (depending on censoredInt option) by 
    Accelerated failure model. 
    - `FALSE` uses the values assigned by cutoffCensored.
- `feature_subset :` 
    - `all` : default
    - `highQuality`  : this option seems to be buggy right now

Check [MSstats documentation](http://msstats.org/) to find out more about 
every option.

### Section: `output_extras`

```
  enabled : 1 # if 0, won't process anything on this section
  annotate :  
    enabled: 1 # if 1, will generate a `-results-annotated.txt` file that 
    including Gene and Protein.Name
    species : HUMAN
  plots:
    volcano: 1
    heatmap: 1
    LFC : -1.5 1.5 # Range of minimal log2fc
    FDR : 0.05
    heatmap_cluster_cols : 0
    heatmap_display : log2FC # log2FC or pvalue
```

- Extra actions to perform based on the MSstats results, including 
*annotations* and *plots* (heatmaps and volcano plots). 
- The supported species are: HUMAN, MOUSE, ANOPHELES, ARABIDOPSIS, BOVINE, 
WORM, CANINE, FLY, ZEBRAFISH, ECOLI_STRAIN_K12, ECOLI_STRAIN_SAKAI, CHICKEN, 
RHESUS, MALARIA, CHIMP, RAT, YEAST, PIG, XENOPUS

## Special case: Protein fractionation

To handle protein fractionation experiments, two options need to be activated

1. The keys' file must contain an additional column named "`FractionKey`" with 
the information about fractions. For example:

**Raw.file**|**IsotopeLabelType**|**Condition**|**BioReplicate**|**Run**|**FractionKey**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
S9524\_Fx1|L|AB|AB-1|1|1
S9524\_Fx2|L|AB|AB-1|1|2
S9524\_Fx3|L|AB|AB-1|1|3
S9524\_Fx4|L|AB|AB-1|1|4
S9524\_Fx5|L|AB|AB-1|1|5
S9524\_Fx6|L|AB|AB-1|1|6
S9524\_Fx7|L|AB|AB-1|1|7
S9524\_Fx8|L|AB|AB-1|1|8
S9524\_Fx9|L|AB|AB-1|1|9
S9524\_Fx10|L|AB|AB-1|1|10
S9525\_Fx1|L|AB|AB-2|2|1
S9525\_Fx2|L|AB|AB-2|2|2
S9525\_Fx3|L|AB|AB-2|2|3
S9525\_Fx4|L|AB|AB-2|2|4
S9525\_Fx5|L|AB|AB-2|2|5
S9525\_Fx6|L|AB|AB-2|2|6
S9525\_Fx7|L|AB|AB-2|2|7
S9525\_Fx8|L|AB|AB-2|2|8
S9525\_Fx9|L|AB|AB-2|2|9
S9525\_Fx10|L|AB|AB-2|2|10
S9526\_Fx1|L|AB|AB-3|3|1
S9526\_Fx2|L|AB|AB-3|3|2
S9526\_Fx3|L|AB|AB-3|3|3
S9526\_Fx4|L|AB|AB-3|3|4
S9526\_Fx5|L|AB|AB-3|3|5
S9526\_Fx6|L|AB|AB-3|3|6
S9526\_Fx7|L|AB|AB-3|3|7
S9526\_Fx8|L|AB|AB-3|3|8
S9526\_Fx9|L|AB|AB-3|3|9
S9526\_Fx10|L|AB|AB-3|3|10

2. Enable *fractions* in the configuration file as follow:

```
fractions: 
  enabled : 1 # 1 for protein fractions, 0 otherwise
```

## Special case: SILAC

One of the most widely used techniques that enable relative protein 
quantification is *stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture* 
(SILAC). The keys file can capture the typical SILAC experiment. 
The following example shows a SILAC experiment with two conditions, 
two biological replicates, and two technical replicates:

**RawFile**|**IsotopeLabelType**|**Condition**|**BioReplicate**|**Run**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
QE20140321-01|H|iso|iso-1|1
QE20140321-02|H|iso|iso-1|2
QE20140321-04|L|iso|iso-2|3
QE20140321-05|L|iso|iso-2|4
QE20140321-01|L|iso\_M|iso\_M-1|1
QE20140321-02|L|iso\_M|iso\_M-1|2
QE20140321-04|H|iso\_M|iso\_M-2|3
QE20140321-05|H|iso\_M|iso\_M-2|4

It is also required to activate the *silac* option in the yaml file as follows:

```
silac: 
  enabled : 1 # 1 for SILAC experiments
```













# Quality Control Analysis

Three functions are available to perform QC analyses. For illustrative 
purposes, an example dataset consisting of a reduced version of two head 
and neck cancer cell lines (conditions `"Cal33"` and `"HSC6"`), 2 biological 
replicates each. The number of peptides was reduced to 1/5 due to bioconductor 
limitations on data size.

- Evidence file: `artms_data_ph_evidence`
- Keys file: `artms_data_ph_keys`

The full data set (2 conditions, 4 biological replicates) can be found at the 
following urls:

```
url_evidence <- 'http://kroganlab.ucsf.edu/artms/ph/evidence.txt'
url_keys <- 'http://kroganlab.ucsf.edu/artms/ph/evidence.txt'
```

## Basic QC (`evidence.txt`-based)

The basic quality control analysis takes as input both the `evidence.txt`
and `keys.txt`. 

```{r, }
artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic(evidence_file = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                                  keys_file = artms_data_ph_keys,
                                  output_name = "qcPlots_evidence",
                                  prot_exp = "PH")
```

Running `artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic()` generates the following `pdf` 
files:

- **-basicReproducibility.pdf**: correlation dot plot for all the combinations 
of biological replicates of conditions, based on MS Intensity values using 
features (peptide+charge)
- **-correlationMatrixBR.pdf**: It contains 3 pages. *Correlation matrix* for 
all the biological replicates using MS Intensity values, *Clustering matrix* 
of the MS Intensities and correlation distribution *histogram*.
- **-correlationMatrixBR.pdf**: Same as the previous one, but based on 
MS Intensity values of Conditions
- **-IntensityDistributions.pdf**: 2 pages. *Box-dot plot* and *Jitter plot* 
of biological replicates based on MS (raw) intensity values.
- **-intensityStats.pdf**: several pages, including bar plots of 
*Total Sum of Intensities in BioReplicates*, *Total Sum of Intensities in 
Conditions*, *Total Peptide Counts in BioReplicates*, 
*Total Peptide Counts in conditions* separated by categories 
(`CON`: contaminants, `PROT` peptides,
`REV` reversed sequences used by MaxQuant to estimate the FDR); *Box plots* 
of MS Intensity values per biological replicates and conditions; *bar plots* 
of total intensity (excluding contaminants) by bioreplicates and conditions; 
Barplots of *total feature counts* by bioreplicates and conditions.
- **-ptmStats.pdf**: If any PTM is selected (`PH`, `UB`, `AC`) an extra pdf 
file will be generated with stats related to the selected modification, 
including: *bar plot of peptide counts and intensities*, broken by 
`PTM/other` categories; bar plots of *total sum-up of MS intensity values* by 
other/PTM categories.

Check `?artms_evidenceQCbasic()` to find out more options about this function. 

## Extended QC (`evidence.txt`-based)

It takes as input the `evidence.txt` and `keys.txt` files as follows:

```{r}
artmsQualityControlEvidenceExtended(evidence_file = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                                     keys_file = artms_data_ph_keys)
```

It generates the following QC files:

- CS: charge state plot: Page 1 shows the charge state distribution of PSMs 
confidently identified in each BioReplicate.
- IDoverlap: pairwise identification heatmap overlap: Pages 1 and 2 show 
pairwise peptide and protein overlap between any 2 BioReplicates, respectively. 
- IONS: peptide ion statistics plot: A peptide ion is defined in the context
of m/z, in other words, an unique peptide sequence may give rise to multiple 
ions with different charge state and/or amino acid modification. Page 1 shows
the number of ions confidently identified in each BioReplicate . 
If replicates are present, Page 2 shows the mean number of peptide ions per 
condition with error bar showing the standard error of the mean. 
Note that potential contaminant proteins are plotted separately.  
- ME: precursor mass error plot: Page 1 shows the distribution of precursor 
error for all PSMs confidently identified in each BioReplicate.
- MOCD: precursor mass-over-charge plot: Page 1 shows the distribution of 
precursor mass-over-charge for all PSMs confidently identified in each 
BioReplicate. 
- PEPDETECT: peptide detection frequency plot: Page 1 summarizes the 
frequency that each peptide is detected across BioReplicates of each 
condition, showing the percentage of peptides detected once, twice, thrice, 
and so on (for whatever number of replicates each condition has).
- PEPICV: peptide intensity coefficient of variance (CV) plot: The CV is 
calculated for each feature (peptide ion) identified in more than one 
replicate. Page 1 shows the distribution of CV's for each condition, while 
Page 2 shows the distribution of CV's within 4 bins of intensity (i.e., 4 
quantiles of average intensity).
- PEPTIDES: peptide statistics plot: Page 1 shows the number of unique 
peptide sequences (disregard the charge state or amino acid modifications) 
confidently identified in each BioReplicate. If replicates are present, 
Page 2 shows the mean number of peptides per condition with error bar showing 
the standard error of the mean. Note that potential contaminant proteins
are plotted separately. Pages 3 and 4 show peptide identification intersection
between BioReplicates (the bars are ordered by degree or frequency, 
respectively), and Page 4 shows the intersections across conditions instead 
of BioReplicates.
- PIO: oversampling statistics plot: Page 1 shows the proportion of all 
peptide ions (including peptides matched across runs) fragmented once, 
twice and thrice or more. Page 2 shows the  proportion of peptide ions 
(with intensity detected) fragmented once, twice and thrice or more. 
Page 3 shows the proportion of peptide ions (with intensity detected and 
MS/MS identification) fragmented once, twice and thrice or more
- PROTDETECT: protein detection frequency plot: Page 1 summarizes the 
frequency that each protein group is detected across BioReplicates of 
each condition, showing the percentage of proteins detected once, twice, 
thrice, and so on (for whatever number of replicates each condition has). 
Page 2 shows the feature (peptide ion) intensity distribution within each 
BioReplicate (potential contaminant proteins are plot separately). Page 3 
shows the density of feature intensity for different feature types (i.e., 
MULTI-MSMS, MULTI-SECPEP).
- PROTEINS: protein statistics plot: Page 1 shows the number of protein 
groups confidently identified in each BioReplicate. If replicates are 
present, Page 2 shows the mean number of protein groups per condition with 
error bar showing the standard error of the mean. Note that potential 
contaminant proteins are plotted separately.Pages 3 and 4 show peptide
identification intersection between BioReplicates (the bars are ordered 
by degree or frequency, respectively), and Page 4 shows the intersections 
across conditions instead of BioReplicates.
- PROTICV: protein intensity coefficient of variance (CV) plot: The CV is 
calculated for each protein (after summing the peptide intensities) identified
in more than one replicate. Page 1 shows the distribution of CV's for 
each condition, while Page 2 shows the distribution of CV's within 4 bins 
of intensity (i.e., 4 quantiles of average intensity).
- PSM: peptide-spectrum-matches (PSMs) statistics plot: Page 1 shows the
number of PSMs confidently identified in each BioReplicate. If replicates 
are present, Page 2 shows the mean number of PSMs per condition with error
bar showing the standard error of the mean. Note that potential contaminant
proteins are plotted separately. 
- TYPE: identification type statistics plot: MaxQuant classifies each 
peptide identification into different categories (e.g., MSMS, MULTI-MSMS, 
MULTI-SECPEP). Page 1 shows the distribution of identification type in each 
BioReplicate

## Extended QC (`evidence.txt`-based)

It takes as input the `evidence.txt` and `keys.txt` files as follows:

```{r}
artmsQualityControlEvidenceExtended(evidence_file = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                                     keys_file = artms_data_ph_keys)
```

It generates the following QC files:

## Extended QC (`summary.txt` based)

requires two files:

- `keys.txt`
- MaxQuant `summary.txt` file. As described by MaxQuant's `table.pdf`, the 
summary file contains summary information for all the raw files processed 
with a single MaxQuant run, including statistics on the peak detection. `artmsQualityControlSummaryExtended()` gathers a quick overview on the 
quality of every RawFile based on this `summary.txt`.

Run it as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsQualityControlSummaryExtended(summary_file = "summary.txt",
                                    keys_file = artms_data_ph_keys)
```

It generates the following `pdf` plots:

- MS1SCANS: generates MS1 scan counts plot: 
Page 1 shows the number of MS1 scans in each BioReplicate. 
If replicates are present, Page 2 shows the mean number of MS1 scans 
per condition with error bar showing the standard error of the mean. 
If isFractions `TRUE`, each fraction is a stack on the individual bar graphs. 

- MS2: generates MS2 scan counts plot: 
Page 1 shows the number of MSs scans in each BioReplicate. 
If replicates are present, Page 2 shows the mean number of MS1 scans per 
condition with error bar showing the standard error of the mean. 
If isFractions `TRUE`, each fraction is a stack on the individual bar graphs. 

- MSMS: generates MS2 identification rate (%) plot: 
Page 1 shows the fraction of MS2 scans confidently identified in each 
BioReplicate. If replicates are present, Page 2 shows the mean rate of MS2 
scans confidently identified per condition with error bar showing the 
standard error of the mean. 
If isFractions `TRUE`, each fraction is a stack on the individual bar graphs.

- ISOTOPE: generates Isotope Pattern counts plot: 
Page 1 shows the number of Isotope Patterns with charge greater than 1 in 
each BioReplicate. If replicates are present, Page 2 shows the mean number 
of Isotope Patterns with charge greater than 1 per condition with error bar 
showing the standard error of the mean. 
If isFractions `TRUE`, each fraction is a stack on the individual bar graphs.


# Relative quantification

The relative quantification is the core of this package. All the information 
required to run a relative quantification analysis using `MSstats` is 
provided through a configuration file (`.yaml` format). Check the above to 
find out more about the different sections of the configuration file.

A template of the configuration file can be generated by running 
`artmsWriteConfigYamlFile()`.

Different types of proteomics experiments can be analyzed such as protein 
abundance (ab), affinity purification mass spectrometry (apms), and different 
type of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation (ph), 
ubiquitination (ub), and acetylation (ac)







## Quantification of Changes in Protein Abundance

It quantifies changes in protein abundance between two different conditions.
These are the specific sections that the user has to filled up:

```
files:
  evidence : /path/to/the/evidence.txt
  keys : /path/to/the/keys.txt
  contrasts : /path/to/the/contrast.txt
  output : /path/to/the/output/results_ptmGlobal/results.txt
  .
  .
  .
data:
  .
  .
  .
  filters:
    modifications : AB 
```

Make sure that the filter `modifications` is labeled as `AB`.

Finally, run the following `artMS` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsQuantification(
  yaml_config_file = '/path/to/config/file/artms_ab_config.yaml')
```



## Quantification of Changes in Global Phosphorylation / Ubiquitination

The **global phosphorylation / ubiquitination** quantification analysis 
calculates changes in phosphorylation/ubiquitination at the *protein level*. 
This means that all the **modified** peptides are used to quantify changes
in protein phosphorylation/ubiquitination between different conditions. 
The **site-specific** (explained next) quantifies changes at the 
*peptide level*, i.e., each modified peptide independently between the
different conditions.

Only two sections need to be filled up on the **default** configuration
(`yaml`) file:

```
files:
  evidence : /path/to/the/evidence.txt
  keys : /path/to/the/keys.txt
  contrasts : /path/to/the/contrast.txt
  output : /path/to/the/output/results_ptmGlobal/results.txt
  .
  .
  .
data:
  .
  .
  .
  filters:
    modifications : PH # Use UB for ubiquination
```

The remaining options can be left unmodified. 

Once the configuration `yaml` file is ready, run the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsQuantification(
  yaml_config_file = '/path/to/config/file/artms_phglobal_config.yaml')
```

## Site-specific Quantification of Changes in Phosphorylation / Ubiquitination

The `site-specific` analysis quantifies changes at the modified peptide level.
This means that changes in every modified (ph/ub) peptide of a given protein
will be quantified individually. The caveat is that the proportion of missing 
values should increase relative to the **global** analysis. Both **site** and
**global** ptm analysis are highly correlated due to the fact that only one 
or two peptides drive the overall changes in PTMs for every protein.

To run a site specific analysis follow these steps:

1. A pre-processing step is required to be run on the evidence file to enable 
the site-specific ph analysis. 

For phosphorylation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsProtein2SiteConversion(
  evidence_file = "/path/to/the/evidence.txt", 
  ref_proteome_file = "/path/to/the/reference_proteome.fasta", 
  output_file = "/path/to/the/output/ph-sites-evidence.txt", 
  mod_type = "PH")
```

For ubiquitination

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsProtein2SiteConversion(
  evidence_file = "/path/to/the/evidence.txt", 
  ref_proteome_file = "/path/to/the/reference_proteome.fasta", 
  output_file = "/path/to/the/output/ub-sites-evidence.txt", 
  mod_type = "UB")
```


2. Generate a new configuration file (`phsites_config.yaml` or 
`ubsites_config.yaml`) as explained above, but using the "new" `ph-sites-evidence.txt`/`ub-sites-evidence.txt` file instead of the original
`evidence.txt` file. Only two sections need to be filled up on the **default** 
configuration (`yaml`) file:

```
files:
  evidence : /path/to/the/evidence-site.txt
  keys : /path/to/the/keys.txt
  contrasts : /path/to/the/contrast.txt
  output : /path/to/the/output/results_ptmSITES/sites-results.txt
  .
  .
  .
data:
  .
  .
  .
  filters:
    modifications : PH # Use UB for ubiquination
```

Once the new `yaml` file has been created, execute:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsQuantification(
  yaml_config_file = '/path/to/config/file/phsites_config.yaml')
```







# Analysis of Quantifications

Comprehensive analysis of the quantification obtained running 
`artmsQuantification()`. It includes:

- Annotations
- Summary files in different formats (xls, txt) and shapes (long, wide)
- Numerous summary plots
- Enrichment analysis using Gprofiler
- PCA of protein abundance
- PCA of quantification
- Clustering analysis

It takes as input two files generated from the previous quantification step 
(`artmsQuantification()`)

- `-results.txt` : MSstats quantification results
- `-results_ModelQC.txt` : MSstats normalized abundance values

To run this analysis

1. Set as the working directory the folder with the results obtained from 
`artmsQuantification()`.

```
setwd('~/path/to/the/results_quantification/')
```

And then run the following function (for an "AB" experiment)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
artms_analysisQuantifications(log2fc_file = "ab-results.txt",
                              modelqc_file = "ab-results_ModelQC.txt",
                              species = "human",
                              output_dir = "AnalysisQuantifications")
```

A few comments about the available options for `artms_analysisQuantifications`:

- `isPTM`. For both protein abundance (`AB`), Affinity Purification-Mass 
Spectrometry (`APMS`), and global analysis of posttranslational modifications 
(`PH` and `UB`) analyses use the option `"noptm"`. For a site specific 
PTM analysis use `"ptmsites"`.
- `species`. This downstream analysis supports (for now) `"human"` and 
`"mouse"`
- `enrich`. If `TRUE`, it will perform enrichment analysis using `gProfileR`
- `isBackground`. If `enrich = TRUE`, the user can provide a background 
gene list (add the file path as well)
- `mnbr`: Minimal Number of Biological Replicates for imputation. Missing 
values will be imputed and this argument is set to specified the minimal 
number of biological replicates that are required in at least one of the 
conditions, but for all the proteins For example, `mnbr = 2` would mean
that only proteins found in *at least* two biological replicates will be 
imputed. In addition, for any other protein should be identified in at least
one condition in two biological replicates or it will be removed. That is,
if `mnbr = 2`, if a protein was found in two conditions but only in one
biological replicate (in both conditions), it will be remove.
- `l2fc_thres` is the log2fc cutoff for enrichment analysis, absolute 
value, i.e., if it is set to 1, it will consider significant log2fc> +1 
and log2fc < -1. 
- `ipval`: specify whether `pvalue` or `adjpvalue` should use for the analysis.
The default option is `adjpvalue` (multiple testing correction). 
But if the number of biological replicates for a given experiment is too 
low (for example n = 2), then `pvalue` is recommended. 

# Miscellaneous: a little bit of everything

`artMS` also provides a number of very handy functions.

## Annotate table with Gene Symbol and Name based on Uniprot ID(s)

Annotate gene name and symbol based on uniprot ids. It will take the column 
from your data.frame specified by the columnid argument, search for the 
gene symbol, name, and entrez based on the species (sps argument) and merge 
the information back to the input data.frame

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This example adds annotations to the evidence file available in
# artMS, based on the column 'Proteins'.

evidence_anno <- artmsAnnotationUniprot(x = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                                         columnid = 'Proteins',
                                         sps = 'human')
```


## Average Intensity, RT, CR

Taking as input the evidence file location, it will summarize and report back 
the average intensity, average retention time, and the average caliberated
retention time for each protein. If a list of proteins is provided, then only 
those proteins will be summarized and returned. Check `?artmsAvgIntensityRT()` 
to find out more options.


```
artmsAvgIntensityRT(evidence_file = '/path/to/the/evidence.txt)
```

## Change Column Name

Change a specific column name in a given data.frame

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artms_data_ph_evidence <- artmsChangeColumnName(
                               dataset = artms_data_ph_evidence,
                               oldname = "Phospho..STY.",
                               newname = "PH_STY")
```

## Individual abundance dot plots

Protein abundance dot plots for each unique uniprot id. It can take a long time

```{r, eval = FALSE}
artmsDataPlots(input_file = "results/ab-results-mss-normalized.txt",
               output_file = "results/ab-results-mss-normalized.pdf")
```

## Enrichment analysis function

Enrichment analysis based on a data.frame with `Gene` and `Comparison`/`Label` 
protein (i.e, typical MSstats results)

```{r}
# The data must be annotated (Protein and Gene columns)
data_annotated <- artmsAnnotationUniprot(
                      x = artms_data_ph_msstats_results,
                      columnid = "Protein",
                      sps = "human")
# And then the enrichment
enrich_set <- artmsEnrichLog2fc(
                   dataset = data_annotated,
                   species = "human",
                   background = unique(data_annotated$Gene))
```

## Enrichment analysis using gProfileR

Function that simplifies enrichment analysis using gProfileR

```{r}
# annotate the MSstats results to get the Gene name
data_annotated <- artmsAnnotationUniprot(
                                     x = artms_data_ph_msstats_results,
                                     columnid = "Protein",
                                     sps = "human")

# Filter the list of genes with a log2fc > 2
filtered_data <- 
unique(data_annotated$Gene[which(data_annotated$log2FC > 2)])

# And perform enrichment analysis
data_annotated_enrich <- artmsEnrichProfiler(
                                   x = filtered_data,
                                   categorySource = c('KEGG'),
                                   species = "hsapiens",
                                   background = unique(data_annotated$Gene))
```


## MaxQuant evidence file to SAINTexpress format

Converts the MaxQuant evidence file to the 3 required files by [SAINTexpress](http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html). Choose one of the 
following quantitative MS metrics:

- MS spectral counts (use msspc)
- MS intensities (use msint)

```{r}
# Testing that the files cannot be empty
artmsEvidenceToSaintExpress(evidence_file = NULL, 
keys_file = NULL, ref_proteome_file = NULL)
```


## MaxQuant evidence file to SAINTq format

Converts the MaxQuant evidence file to the required files by [SAINTq](http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html). The user can filter 
based on either peptides with spectral counts (use `msspc`) or all the peptides
(use `all`) for the analysis. The quantitative metric can be also chosen 
(either MS intensity or spectral counts)

```{r}
# Testing that the files cannot be empty
artmsEvidenceToSAINTq(evidence_file = NULL, 
                      keys_file = NULL, 
                      output_dir = NULL)
```

## Generate Phosfate input file

It generates the Phosfate input file from the `imputedL2fcExtended.txt` file 
resulting from running the `artmsAnalysisQuantifications()` on a ph-site 
quantification (see above). Notice that the only species suported by PHOTON 
is humans.

```{r}
artmsPhosfateOutput(inputFile = "your-imputedL2fcExtended.txt")
```

## Generate Photon input file

It generates the Photon input file from the `imputedL2fcExtended.txt` file 
resulting from running the `artmsAnalysisQuantifications()` on a ph-site 
quantification (see above). Please, notice that the only species suported by 
PHOTON is humans.

```{r}
artmsPhotonOutput(inputFile = "your-imputedL2fcExtended.txt")
```


## Remove contaminants and empty proteins from the MaxQuant evidence file

Remove contaminants and erroneously identified 'reverse' sequences by MaxQuant,
in addition to empty protein ids

```{r}
evidencefiltered <- artmsFilterEvidenceContaminants(x = artms_data_ph_evidence)
```


## Generate ph-site specific evidence file

Generate extended detailed ph-site file, where every line is a ph site instead 
of a peptide. Therefore, if one peptide has multiple ph sites it will be 
breaking down in multiple extra lines for each of the sites. 

```{r}
artmsGeneratePhSiteExtended(df = dfobject, 
                             species = "mouse", 
                             ptmType = "ptmsites",
                             output_name = log2fc_file)
```


# Metabolomics

`artMS` enables the relative quantification of untargeted polar metabolites using this and that technology. It requires input files generated with Markview (DJM: can you provide the link). Markerview Software is used to align mass spectrometry data from several samples for comparison. Using the import feature in the software, `.wiff` (or other mass spectrometry experimental data files. DJM: which ones?) are loaded for retention time alignment. Once the data files are selected, a series of windows will appear wherein peak finding, alignment, and filtering options can be entered and selected. These options include minimum spectral peak width, minimum retention time peak width, retention time and mass tolerance, and the ability to filter out peaks that do not appear in more than a user selected number of samples. 

This file is further processed and formatted to perform QC and relative quantification using  artMS functions, as follows:

- **Convert Metabolomics**: Pre-process the markview `.txt` file to generate an "evidence-like" file by running:

```
artmsConvertMetabolomics(input_file = "markview-output.txt", 
                         out_file = "metabolomics-evidence.txt")
```

- **QC Metabolomics**: Perform quality control analysis on the metabolomics data by running: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
artmsQualityControlMetabolomics(evidence_file = "metabolomics-evidence.txt",
                                keys_file = "metabolomics-keys.txt")
```

- **Relative Quantification**: The relative quantification is performed using `MSstats`. It requires a configuration file (`yaml` format, please check above). A template can be generated by running:
`artmsWriteConfigYamlFile(config_file_name = "metab_config.yaml")`.The relative quantification is performed by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
artmsQuantification(yaml_config_file = "metabConfig.yaml")
```
