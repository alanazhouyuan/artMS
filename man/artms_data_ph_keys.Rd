\title{Keys File Example}
\format{Tab delimited file with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{Raw.file}{Raw file processed. Each one should be either a
biological (or technical) replicate}

\item{IsotopeLabelType}{Type of labeling. \code{L} is used for label free
experiments}

\item{Condition}{Label for conditions. Only alpha-numeric characters and
\code{underscore (_)} are allowed}

\item{BioReplicate}{Label for the Biological replicates. The consensus is
to use the same label as the Condition, but adding a \code{dash (-)} corresponding
to the number of biological replicate. For example, \code{Cal-1}, \code{Cal-2},
\code{Cal-3}}

\item{Run}{The MS run number}

\description{
the artMS Keys file provides the details of the experimental
design  for any given proteomics experiment.

To illustrate how the keys file works, the \code{ph_keys} data object
contains the information about a time series experiment from the
\href{http://www.fluomics.org/}{FluOMICS project}. THP1 cells
were infected with Influenza and data collected at different time
points. in addition to the

Data frame with the information about the experimental design.
It provides the metadata of the \code{ph_evidence} data object also available in
this package (see \code{vignettes} to find out more)

Comparison of the phosphoproteome of two head and neck cancer cell lines,
Cal33 and HSC6.

4 replicates per cell line
