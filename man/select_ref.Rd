\description{
This function creates an interactive environment where the user can select which prein(s) to use as a reference when normalizing the different samples prior to analysis. Only proteins that are present in each sample are considered. The user can remove the unnecessary/unwanted proteins by checking the box next to the protein name. One can use the general view of the proteins plotted across the samples, or at a clustering of the proteins.
