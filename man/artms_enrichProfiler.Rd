\title{Enrichment analysis using GprofileR}
\usage{
artms_enrichProfiler(x, categorySource = c("GO"), specie,
  background = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(list, data.frame) List of protein ids. It can be anything:
either a list of ids, or you could also send a data.frame and it will find
the columns with the IDs. Is not cool? Multiple list can be also sent
simultaneously, as for example running:
\code{tmp <- split(enrichment$Gene, enrichment$cl_number, drop= TRUE)}}

\item{categorySource}{(vector) Resources providing the terms on which
the enrichment will be performed. The supported resources by gprofiler are:
\itemize{
\item GO (GO:BP, GO:MF, GO:CC): Gene Ontology (see more below)
\item KEGG: Biological pathways
\item REAC: Biological pathways (Reactome)
\item TF: Regulatory motifs in DNA (TRANSFAC TFBS)
\item MI: Regulatory motifs in DNA (miRBase microRNAs)
\item CORUM: protein complexes database
\item HP: Human Phenotype Ontology
\item HPA: Protein databases (Human Protein Atlas)
\item OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man annotations:
\item BIOGRID: BioGRID protein-protein interactions
The type of annotations for Gene Ontology:
\item Inferred from experiment (IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP)
\item Direct assay (IDA) / Mutant phenotype (IMP]
\item Genetic interaction (IGI) / Physical interaction (IPI)
\item Traceable author (TAS) / Non-traceable author (NAS) /
Inferred by curator (IC)
\item Expression pattern (IEP) / Sequence or structural similarity (ISS)
/ Genomic context (IGC)
\item Biological aspect of ancestor (IBA) / Rapid divergence (IRD)
\item Reviewed computational analysis (RCA) / Electronic annotation (IEA)
\item No biological data (ND) / Not annotated or not in background (NA)
}}

\item{specie}{(char) Specie code: Organism names are constructed by concatenating
the first letter of the name and the family name.
Example: human - ’hsapiens’, mouse - ’mmusculus’.}

\item{background}{(vector) gene list to use as background for the enrichment
analysis. Default: \code{NA}}
}
\value{
The enrichment results as provided by gprofiler

\description{
This function simplifies the enrichment analysis performed by
the excellent tool GprofileR.

\item hier_filtering = "none"
\item domain_size = "known" # annotated or known
\item numeric_ns = ""
\item png_fn = NULL
\item include_graph = TRUE
