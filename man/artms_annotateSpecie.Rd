\title{Adding a column with the specie name}
\usage{
artms_annotateSpecie(df, pathogen, specie)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame with a \code{Protein} column (of uniprot ids)}

\item{pathogen}{Is there a pathogen in the dataset as well? if it does not,
then use \code{pathogen = nopathogen} (default), \code{tb} (Tuberculosis),
\code{lpn} (Legionella)}

\item{specie}{Main organism (supported for now: \code{human} or \code{mouse})}
}
\value{
The same data.frame but with an extra column specifying the specie
}
\description{
Adding the specie name to every protein.
This makes more sense if there are more than one specie in the dataset,
which must be specified in the \code{pathogen} option. Influenza is a special
case that it does not need to be specified, as far as the proteins were
originally annotated as \code{INFLUENZAGENE_STRAIN}
(strains covered \code{H1N1}, \code{H3N2}, \code{H5N1}), as for example, \code{NS1_H1N1}
