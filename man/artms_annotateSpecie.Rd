\title{Adding a column with the specie name}
\usage{
artms_annotateSpecie(df, pathogen = "nopathogen", specie)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(data.frame) with a \code{Protein} column (of uniprot ids)}

\item{pathogen}{(char) Is there a pathogen in the dataset as well?
if it does not, then use \code{pathogen = nopathogen} (default). Supported\code{tb}
(Tuberculosis),
\code{lpn} (Legionella)}

\item{specie}{(char) Host organism (supported for now: \code{human} or \code{mouse})}
}
\value{
(data.frame) The same data.frame but with an extra column
specifying the specie
}
\description{
Adding the specie name to every protein.
This makes more sense if there are more than one specie in the dataset,
which must be specified in the \code{pathogen} option. Influenza is a special
case that it does not need to be specified, as far as the proteins were
originally annotated as \code{INFLUENZAGENE_STRAIN}
(strains covered \code{H1N1}, \code{H3N2}, \code{H5N1}), as for example, \code{NS1_H1N1}
}
\examples{
# Adding a new column with the main specie of the data. Easy.
# But the main functionality is to add both the host-specie and a pathogen,
# which is not illustrated in this example
