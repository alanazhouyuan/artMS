Description: artMS provides a set of tools for the analysis of proteomics 
    label-free datasets. It takes as input the MaxQuant search result 
    output (evidence.txt file) and performs quality control, 
    relative quantification using MSstats, and downstream analysis 
    and integration. artMS also provides a set of functions to re-format 
    and make it compatible with other analytical tools, 
    including MIST, SAINT, and CompPASS.
