New version 1.3.3 (2019-06-11)

+ Fix: Refactored code to better handle SILAC data in QC and quantifications
+ New function to hack SILAC data
+ Keeps adding `na.rm = TRUE` to ggplots 
+ Improves QC plots
+ Overall code formating (going back to my prefered style)


New version 1.3.2 (2019-05-11)

+ Fix: add PH check for new maxquant versions in basic QC plot function
+ New function to add error bars in plots

New version 1.3.1 (2019-05-07)

+ Fix artmsProtein2SiteConversion package dependency

New version 1.3.0 (2019-05-01)

+ Bioconductor release: update version (from 1.1 to 1.3)

Changes in version v1.1.17 (2019-05-27)

+ Minor changes in code

Changes in version v1.1.16 (2019-04-27)

+ The configuration file also includes the option to activate quality control 
based on the summary.txt file 
+ Improve messages to the user


Changes in version v1.1.15 (2019-04-24)

+ artMS detects RefSeq IDs. It does not support yet enrichments and annotations
+ Update artmsAnalysisQuantifications to adjust for previous changes in PTMs: it better handles 'protein groups'
+ Doesn't remove outliers

Changes in version v1.1.14 (2019-04-22)

+ Update artmsProtein2SiteConversion: it runs as default the "Leading razor 
protein".
+ Update vignette

Changes in version v1.1.13 (2019-04-20)

+ Important artmsProtein2SiteConversion update: the protein column id to be 
converted to the 'site/peptide specific' notation (i.e. ProteinID_AAnumber) 
can be now selected by the user.
This is important because if the user decides to remove the protein groups,
the 'leading razor protein' is chosen as the main protein id column, therefore
the user would have to choose that protein when converting the file.

+ artmsQuantification is now able to process full uniprot ids 
(sp|ENTRY|ENTRY_NAME ...): it detects and extracts the ENTRY id

+ Depracated: artmsReplicatePlots


Changes in version v1.1.12 (2019-04-07)

+ Fix: filtering by group uses the Leading Razor Protein when the filter
"protein_groups: remove" is selected
+ Fix: `plotSP` of `artmsQualityControlEvidenceExtended` fails with old versions
of MaxQuant
+ artmsProtein2SiteConversion also processes RefSeq annotations

Changes in version v1.1.11 (2019-03-25)

+ Fix: column namne MS/MS count for old versions of MaxQuant

Changes in version v1.1.10 (2019-02-22)
